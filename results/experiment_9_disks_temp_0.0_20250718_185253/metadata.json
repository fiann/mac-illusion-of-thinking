  "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant. Solve this puzzle for me.\n\nThere are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg. The disks are\nnumbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of\n   another stack.\n3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n\nExample: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1],\n[], []], and a solution might be:\n\n```\nmoves = [[1 , 0 , 2] , [2 , 0 , 1] , [1 , 2 , 1] , [3 , 0 , 2] ,\n[1 , 1 , 0] , [2 , 1 , 2] , [1 , 0 , 2]]\n```\n\nThis means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on.\nRequirements:\n\n- When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corre-\n  sponding complete list of moves.\n- The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n- Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format:\n  moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]\n\n\nNow solve for 9 disks. The initial state is [[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [], []]."
